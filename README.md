# JAVA Academy: OOP Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction

In this course we analyzed a problem about the adoption system of pets. It was graphed as a uml diagram. This allowed us to developed it on java using the four pillars of OOP: abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, in five challenges.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the terminal of your choice
3. Follow the instruction for each challenge

## Dependencies

1. Terminal of your choice
2. IDE with JAVA extension

## Instructions

**First Challenge**

In this challenge you need to identify the objects in a problem. The problem was the adoption system of a dog.

1. In your terminal go to the OOP-MMA directory with the command `cd OOP-MMA/`
2. Open the file *AdoptioSystem.txt* with the command `code AdoptioSystem.txt`

**First Challenge Output**

**Second Challenge**

In this challenge we need to generate a new analysis, apply inheritance to better abstract the problem and stablish an uml diagram. The problem change to the adoption of pets from different species.

1. Click on [uml diagram](http://i.imgur.com/bxWNLck.png) to see it.

**Third Challenge**

The objective for this challenge was to create a constructor method in JAVA

1. Move to the directory Java using the the command `cd Java/`
2. Run the command `code Java/Dog.java`

**Third Challenge Output**

**Forth Challenge**

This challenge allows you to chosse any programming language to reflect the inheritance of the *Account, Adoption Center,* and *Adoptive Family classes*.

1. In your terminal run the command `code Account.java AdoptionCenter.java AdoptiveFamily.java`

**Forth Challenge Output**

**Fifth Challenge**

In this challenge we apply polymorphism tothe method `printDataPet` of *Pet class* in *Parrot class*. Therefore, if you  call `printDataPet` from an instance of *Parrot class* this also can print *size, color* and *age* besides *species, id* and *name*

1. In your terminal run the command `code Pet.java Parrot.java`

**Fifth Challenge Output**
